# Process Control Methods and Algorithms for Parabolic Solar Trough Collectors: A Comprehensive Literature Review

## Abstract

This literature review examines the academic developments in process control methods and algorithms for parabolic solar trough collectors (PTCs), with a focus on real-time outlet fluid temperature control of one or multiple collector lines. The review covers established control engineering journals, major control conferences, and renewable energy publications from approximately 1980 to 2025, analyzing the evolution from classical control approaches to advanced model predictive and adaptive control strategies.

## 1. Introduction

Parabolic trough solar collectors represent one of the most mature concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies, with the first commercial installations operating in California's Mojave Desert since 1984. The control objective in these systems is fundamentally challenging: maintaining the outlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid (HTF) around a desired set-point while dealing with highly nonlinear dynamics, transport delays, and significant disturbances from solar irradiance variations and clouds.

The complexity of controlling parabolic trough fields stems from several factors:
- Distributed parameter nature of the thermal dynamics
- Significant transport delays 
- Nonlinear heat transfer characteristics
- Fast, unpredictable variations in solar irradiance
- Coupling between multiple collector loops in large installations

## 2. Historical Development and Key Research Centers

### 2.1 The ACUREX Experimental Facility

Much of the foundational research in solar trough control was conducted at the ACUREX experimental plant at the Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA) in Spain. This facility, consisting of 480 parabolic trough collectors arranged in 10 loops, served as the primary testbed for advanced control strategies from the 1980s through the 2000s. The extensive body of work from researchers led by Eduardo F. Camacho, Manuel Berenguel, and their colleagues at the University of Seville established many of the control methodologies still used today.

### 2.2 Evolution of Control Approaches

The evolution of control strategies for solar trough plants can be categorized into several distinct phases:

1. **Classical Control Era (1980s-1990s)**: Initial approaches using PID, cascade, and feedforward control
2. **Adaptive Control Development (1990s-2000s)**: Introduction of self-tuning and gain-scheduling methods
3. **Model Predictive Control Emergence (2000s-2010s)**: Development of linear and nonlinear MPC strategies
4. **Advanced Integration Era (2010s-present)**: Optimization-based approaches, distributed control, and AI integration

## 3. Classical Control Approaches

### 3.1 PID Control

Early control systems for parabolic trough collectors employed conventional PID controllers, often enhanced with feedforward compensation for solar irradiance disturbances. However, simple PID control proved inadequate for achieving fast, well-damped responses due to the inherent resonance characteristics of distributed collector fields.

**Key Findings:**
- Standard PID tuning methods like Ziegler-Nichols often resulted in oscillatory behavior
- Resonance dynamics at low frequencies were identified as the primary cause of poor performance
- Modern optimization approaches using nature-inspired algorithms (Self-adaptive Differential Evolution, African Vultures Optimization) have been applied to PID tuning with improved results

### 3.2 Cascade Control

Cascade control schemes were developed to improve disturbance rejection by using intermediate temperature measurements. The typical configuration involves:
- **Primary loop**: Controls outlet temperature
- **Secondary loop**: Controls intermediate collector temperature or steam flow rate

This approach provided better performance than single-loop PID, particularly for handling inlet temperature disturbances and improving response to solar irradiance changes.

### 3.3 Feedforward Control

Series feedforward control became essential for dealing with measurable disturbances, particularly:
- Solar irradiance variations
- Inlet fluid temperature changes
- Ambient temperature fluctuations

The feedforward component transforms the nonlinear plant into a more manageable uncertain linear system, enabling the application of linear control techniques.

## 4. Adaptive Control Strategies

### 4.1 Self-Tuning Regulators

Adaptive control methods were developed to handle the time-varying nature of solar collector dynamics. Key contributions include:

- **Gain-scheduling approaches**: Parameters adjusted based on operating conditions
- **Recursive least squares estimation**: Online parameter identification for model updates
- **Self-tuning PID controllers**: Automatic adjustment of controller parameters

### 4.2 Resonance Cancellation

A significant breakthrough was the understanding of resonance characteristics in distributed collector fields. Specialized adaptive controllers were developed to:
- Cancel out resonance dynamics explicitly
- Provide faster, well-damped responses
- Maintain stability across varying operating conditions

### 4.3 Robustness Considerations

Adaptive controllers incorporated robustness measures to handle:
- Model uncertainties
- Unmodeled dynamics
- Sensor noise and measurement delays

## 5. Model Predictive Control (MPC)

### 5.1 Linear MPC Developments

Model Predictive Control emerged as a dominant strategy for solar trough control due to its ability to:
- Handle constraints explicitly
- Incorporate disturbance predictions
- Optimize performance over a prediction horizon

**Key Linear MPC Variants:**
- **Generalized Predictive Control (GPC)**: Applied successfully to the ACUREX field
- **Dynamic Matrix Control (DMC)**: With filters for improved robustness
- **Observer-based MPC**: Incorporating state estimation for unmeasured variables

### 5.2 Nonlinear MPC

Recognition of the inherently nonlinear nature of solar collectors led to nonlinear MPC development:
- Direct optimization of nonlinear plant models
- Fuzzy model-based nonlinear MPC for reduced computational burden
- Practical NMPC with stability guarantees

### 5.3 Distributed and Decentralized MPC

For large-scale solar fields, distributed control architectures became necessary:
- **Centralized MPC**: Optimal but computationally intensive
- **Distributed MPC**: Decomposition into smaller, manageable problems
- **Logic-based distributed approaches**: Near-optimal performance with reduced computation

## 6. Advanced Control Techniques

Optimal control formulations address the fundamental question: "What is the optimal outlet temperature for maximum energy production?"

Research has shown that:
- Operating at maximum allowable temperature is not always optimal
- Optimal temperature varies with solar radiation levels

### 6.2 Robust Control

Robust control techniques address model uncertainty and disturbances:
- **Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT)**: Guaranteed specifications under uncertainty
