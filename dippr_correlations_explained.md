# DIPPR Correlations Explained

## What are DIPPR Correlations?

**DIPPR** stands for **Design Institute for Physical Property Research** - a consortium of chemical companies and universities that develops standardized methods for estimating physical and thermodynamic properties of chemicals.

DIPPR correlations are **industry-standard mathematical equations** used to predict how physical properties vary with temperature (and sometimes pressure). They are the "gold standard" in chemical engineering for property modeling.

## Why DIPPR Correlations Matter

### üè≠ **Industry Standard**
- Used by virtually all chemical engineering software (Aspen Plus, HYSYS, etc.)
- Required for process design, safety analysis, and equipment sizing
- Peer-reviewed and validated against extensive experimental data

### üìà **Superior Accuracy**
- Developed using large databases of experimental measurements
- Mathematical forms chosen for optimal fitting across wide temperature ranges
- Include proper physical behavior at limits (critical point, etc.)

### üå°Ô∏è **Temperature Extrapolation**
- Reliable prediction outside the fitted temperature range
- Built-in physical constraints prevent unrealistic values
- Critical for safety calculations at extreme conditions

## Common DIPPR Correlation Forms

### **DIPPR100**: General Polynomial
```
Y = A + B*T + C*T¬≤ + D*T¬≥ + E*T‚Å¥
```
**Used for**: Liquid heat capacity, liquid density, thermal conductivity

**Example**: Heat capacity of water
- A = 276370, B = -2090.1, C = 8.125, D = -0.014116, E = 9.3701e-06
- Valid range: 273.16 - 647.07 K

### **DIPPR101**: Antoine-type Equation
```
Y = exp(A + B/T + C*ln(T) + D*T^E)
```
**Used for**: Vapor pressure, viscosity

**Example**: Water vapor pressure
- A = 73.649, B = -7258.2, C = -7.3037, D = 4.1653e-06, E = 2
- Gives pressure in Pa when T is in K

### **DIPPR102**: Extended Antoine
```
Y = A*T^B / (1 + C/T + D/T¬≤)
```
**Used for**: Viscosity, thermal conductivity at high temperatures

### **DIPPR103**: Polynomial with Exponential
```
Y = A + B*exp(-C/T^D)
```
**Used for**: Surface tension, some transport properties

### **DIPPR104**: Polynomial Fraction
```
Y = A + B/T + C/T¬≥ + D/T‚Å∏ + E/T‚Åπ
```
**Used for**: Heat capacity of gases

### **DIPPR105**: Rational Polynomial
```
Y = A / B^(1+(1-T/C)^D)
```
**Used for**: Liquid density near critical point

## Real Example: Water Properties

Let's see how DIPPR correlations work for water:

### Liquid Heat Capacity (DIPPR100):
```python
# Water: Cp_liquid [J/kmol/K] vs T [K]
A, B, C, D, E = 276370, -2090.1, 8.125, -0.014116, 9.3701e-06

def heat_capacity_water(T):
    return A + B*T + C*T**2 + D*T**3 + E*T**4

# At 298.15 K (25¬∞C):
Cp = heat_capacity_water(298.15)  # ‚âà 75,300 J/kmol/K
Cp_specific = Cp / 18.015  # ‚âà 4,180 J/kg/K (familiar value!)
```

### Vapor Pressure (DIPPR101):
```python
import numpy as np

# Water vapor pressure [Pa] vs T [K]
A, B, C, D, E = 73.649, -7258.2, -7.3037, 4.1653e-06, 2

def vapor_pressure_water(T):
    return np.exp(A + B/T + C*np.log(T) + D*T**E)

# At 373.15 K (100¬∞C):
P_vap = vapor_pressure_water(373.15)  # ‚âà 101,325 Pa (1 atm!)
```

## How DIPPR Fits Our SYLTHERM 800 Data

Based on our manufacturer data, here's how DIPPR would improve our correlations:

### Current vs DIPPR Approach:

**Current (Ad-hoc)**:
```python
# Density: œÅ = a + b*T_C + c*T_C¬≤
rho = 1000.0 + (-0.8652)*T_C + (-0.000401)*T_C**2
```

**DIPPR100 Approach**:
```python
# Better fitting, validated form, proper extrapolation
# Density [kg/m¬≥] = f(T [K]) with 5 parameters instead of 3
rho = A + B*T + C*T**2 + D*T**3 + E*T**4
```

### Why DIPPR is Better:

1. **More Parameters**: 5 vs 3 ‚Üí better fit to 45 data points
2. **Physical Constraints**: Built-in limits and proper behavior
3. **Standard Form**: Compatible with all engineering software
4. **Validation**: Peer-reviewed mathematical forms
5. **Extrapolation**: Safer prediction outside fitted range

## DIPPR Database

The DIPPR project maintains a comprehensive database with:
- **2000+ chemicals** with fitted parameters
- **Multiple properties** per chemical
- **Quality ratings** for each correlation
- **Temperature ranges** for validity
- **Uncertainty estimates**

## Implementation in Python Thermo Library

The `thermo` library implements all DIPPR correlations:

```python
from thermo import VaporPressure, VolumeLiquid

# Create property object
psat = VaporPressure(MW=18.015, Tb=373.15, Tc=647.1, Pc=220640)

# Fit DIPPR101 model to data
psat.fit_add_model(Ts=temperatures, data=pressures, model='DIPPR101')

# Use the fitted model
P = psat.T_dependent_property(350.0)  # Pressure at 350 K
```

## Benefits for SYLTHERM 800

Using DIPPR correlations for our SYLTHERM 800 data would provide:
